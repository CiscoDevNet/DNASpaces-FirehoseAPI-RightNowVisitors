# FirehoseAPI-Sample-RightNowVisitors

Firehose API provides multiple events such as device entry, exit, current location, associated profile and more. Cisco DNA Spaces partner would be able to integrate the Firehose API to consume these events to realise many use cases, one such use case is to view the current visitors of a location for a customer. 

This sample application uses Cisco DNA Spaces Firehose API events such as entry, exit, current location and associated profile, builds data pipeline using AWS S3 and AWS Redshift. 

With the data available in Redshift we can build a RightNow Visitors dashboard, this is WIP.
